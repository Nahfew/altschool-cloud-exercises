# Exercise 8
193.16.20.35/29
What is the Network IP, number of hosts, range of IP addresses and broadcast IP from this subnet?
# Solution
- Network IP=193.16.20.32
- Number of hosts=8
- Ranges of IP address= 193.16.20.33 - 193.16.20.38
- Subnet Mask= 255.255.255.248
- Binary subnet mask = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
- Broadcast = 193.16.20.39
